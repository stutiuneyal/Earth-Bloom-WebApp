 A host of benefits exists for those who do backyard gardening. The first benefit is you get nice fruits and vegetables that are local and grown without heavy chemicals and pesticides. You can
 choose what you feel is safe for you and your family.

 For many people, organically grown food is the option they choose. They combine insect-repelling herbs with their vegetable garden to naturally keep insects and wildlife out. 

 Backyard gardening can also be a wonderful teaching tool for children. They can learn the biology of a seed and how it grows, about soil and keeping it healthy with nutrients, and how many
 vegetables do well growing together. 

 These lessons can also drift into teachable moments about patience, working together, and being good stewards of the earth. 

 Backyard gardening has a benefit many don’t think about but it has provoked discussions among Harvard doctors. Gardening includes a lot of physical activity, so it can make you healthier in
 multiple ways. 

 There are several ways to create a backyard garden. You can till a piece of land and grow plants there in a traditional row garden. You can create garden spots all over your yard and combine 
 flowers with herbs or vegetables in ways where they help each other grow. You can also create raised flower beds that are each to access and maintain. 

 Some backyard gardeners who are unfamiliar with how to properly do it start with garden containers. You can grow many things in garden pots from tomatoes, peppers, and lettuces. 

 There are so many plants to see that it may be difficult to decide what you want to grow. The first decision is to decide whether it will be flowers, vegetables, herbs, or a combination. Then,
 ask what are the things you buy most in the grocery store? Those are what you should plant. 

 You may want to do some research to plant herbs that will enhance the flavors of those foods and flowers that may be helpful either to keep insects and vermin away or to offer nutrients to
 your plants. 

 The perfect garden spot is level, has good drainage or slope, and gets several hours of direct sun daily. Full sun is best for a vegetable garden. Land that is near a structure is best because
 a building would protect it from the wind.
